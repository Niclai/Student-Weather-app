# ECS522-weather-app

### What is the project?
This project is a basic weather app with additional niche functions targeted towards helping students.


### Why is the project useful?
Developing this project brings huge benefits towards the large student community. Allowing them to gain more knowledge and insight to plan ahead for
their daily activities. It also provides notifications to when the best time of day to study outside is. 
Most students refrain from studying outside due to the uncertainty of the weather, but by providing real time updates and accurate notifications
this app should provide students with more confidence to do so. 

### How to download the app: 
....


### How to use the app:
When first using the app you are prompted to enter your desired weather conditions for outdoor studying. This can be altered later on if needed.
After inputing conditions, the app will notify you the time of day when you can study outside is. If there are unexpected weather changes, the app will 
also notify you and recalculate the time of day. To navigate the app there are simple buttons and sliders that allow for self-explanatory usage of all the 
different functions provided.
